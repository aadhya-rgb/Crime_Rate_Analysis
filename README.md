# Malaysia Crime Rate Analysis

# Description
This project analyzes district-level crime data in Malaysia (2017–2023) and builds predictive models to understand crime trends and identify high-risk areas. The work aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.

# Dataset

Source: Kaggle (officially reported crime records by Malaysian law enforcement agencies)

Features: State, District, Crime Category, Crime Type, Date, Year, Number of Crimes

Purpose: Predict district-level crime trends and identify regions requiring intervention

# Key Features & Analysis

Explored temporal trends in total crimes per year

Analyzed crime counts by category and district

Visualized distributions and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Machine Learning Models
